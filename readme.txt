In this phase of developing a roman urdu compiler, we made dfa and RE for the language.Then using those, we
designed a lexical analyzer which tokenizes the ru code. We faced some difficulty while deciding on the
order to explore characters for tokenization, but then we realized keywords should be checked first as 
keywords could change into identifiers if more characters are added to them. Apart from that, we did not
face any issue as everything was well documented and explained in class.
